            <p> One of the nicest features of this Jordan model was a hologram on the ankle showing a basketball, the number 23, and the Jumpman logo. The low-top versions of the Jordan XIII were released without this nifty feature though, much to the disappointment
              of many. </p>

            <p>Perhaps Michael's most famous shot ever took place in Game 6 of the Finals against Utah. His final shot before retiring (a second time), his final shot for Chicago, it also proves to be the game winner, handing the team their third consecutive

            <p>While the Air Jordan 12 was still on store shelves, Nike brought forth the JUMPMAN Pro. It was a shoe with many Air Jordan characteristics, including the "JUMPMAN" logo, but not the "Air Jordan" name. Similarly, while the Air Jordan 13 was
              on the store shelves, the JUMPMAN Pro Quick and JUMPMAN Pro Strong came to market. Late 1997 brought forth a troika of shoes that started the JORDAN Brand. </p>

              heretofore only used for the exclusions on insurance policies, on the bottom.) </p>
