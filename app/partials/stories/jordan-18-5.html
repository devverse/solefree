<p>
While both the Jordan XVI and the Jordan XVII were later released with modified models called the "+" model, the Jordan XVIII design was so radically altered that Nike released a whole new shoe.  The basic  design was similar, but the Jordan 18.5 lacked a lace cover and came with a plastic pant-leg stopper and a more prominent Jumpman logo.
